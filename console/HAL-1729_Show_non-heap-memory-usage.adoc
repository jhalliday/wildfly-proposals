== Overview

The memory information in the server status preview currently only shows information about the attribute `heap-memory-usage`, but the resource also provides non-heap memory usage via the attribute `non-heap-memory-usage`.

This issue is about adding the attribute `non-heap-memory-usage` to the server status preview.

== Requirements

The server status preview of the console must contain an additional section about the non-heap memmory usage. 

This new section must contains two values:

1. used non-heap memory
2. commited non-heap memory

The unit for both values is MB. 

== Test Plan

Add a test to verify that both values are present in the server preview.
